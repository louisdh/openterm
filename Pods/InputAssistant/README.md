## Usage
This library provides an `InputAssistantView` class, that is designed to be set as the `inputAccessoryView` of a UITextView or UITextField.

It provides three areas that you can customize.
- Suggestions - A scrollable set of text suggestions.
- Leading/Trailing actions - tappable buttons on either side of the suggestions.
- Empty text - Optional text that can be displayed when there are no suggestions.

Use the `InputAssistantViewDataSource` protocol that allows you to do this customization.

To react to a suggestion being tapped, conform to the `InputAssistantViewDelegate` protocol.

## Example
Take a look at the [Sample App](Sample) for an example of the implementation.
